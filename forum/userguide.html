		<h2>What can the moderator do:</h2>
		<p>The moderator can do everything the admin can when it comes to post (delete, lock, edit, and pin). The moderator can mute members so that they can not post until the admins decide to ban or reverse the mute.</p>
		
		<h2>Badges:</h2>
		<p>There are two types of badges:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Automatic: when these are created they are assigned to the users automitically. These related to lenght of membership and post counts</li>
		<li>Manual: once these are created, the admin then needs to assign them to user on the page for editing users. These can be used for special recognition.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Translating the script:</h2>
		<p>To translate this script from English to any other language:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Open the file /str/strings.xml using a text editor</li>
		<li>You will find all the text that appears on all the page there. Simply translate them one by one</li>
		</ol>
		
				
		<h2>Multi-lingual forum:</h2>
		<p>This is how you create a multi-lingual forum:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Set line 73 in the file /php/config.php to <code>define('MULTI_LANG', true);</code></li>
		<li>Set line 76 in the file /php/config.php to the default language to be used. Use the ISO code for the language. For example, if the default language is French it will be <code>define('PRIMARY_LANG', 'fr');</code></li>
		<li>Set line 79 in the file /php/config.php with the other languages to be used separating them with commas. Use the ISO codes for the languages. For example, if the other languages are German and Spanish, it will be <code>define('OTHER_LANG', 'de,es');</code></li>
		<li>Make copies of the file /str/strings.xml for each of the languages and name them like this strings_{ISO_Code}.xml. For example if the languages will include French, German and Spanish, the files will be named: strings_fr.xml, string_de.xml and strings_es.xml</li>
		<li>Translate each of the new files and you are done.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Redesign the script's look:</h2>
		<p>All the HTML that is used in the script is in the folder "html" and the CSS is in the folder "css"</p>
		<p>The most important file: are <b>/html/base.html</b>, <b>/css/default.html</b>, and <b>/str/strings.xml</b></p>
		
		<h2>Configure the script to use your user management system:</h2>
		<p>Simply open the file /php/users_api.php with a text editor</p>
		<p>For every function in there change it to draw information from your current system</p>
